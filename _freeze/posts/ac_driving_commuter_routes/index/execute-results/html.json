The API will provide the distance and duration of the trip, as well as turn-by-turn directions. The route duration should be considered a \"minimum duration\" because it does not consider traffic. Then I will estimate the duration of the trips with a linear model and compare that to the actual duration from the Mapbox API. I will use the difference between the actual and estimated duration to identify neighborhoods that experience longer or shorter commutes than expected.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(mapboxapi)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(lehdr)\nlibrary(tigris)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(hrbrthemes)\n\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE,\n        scipen = 999,\n        digits = 4)\n\ntheme_set(theme_ipsum())\n\nsf_use_s2(FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Gather data\n\nThe first step is to download the census tract shapefiles for the county:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_20da5a081e49010e6fc6578fbffb3b83'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#get tracts\nallegheny_county_tracts <- tracts(state = \"PA\", county = \"Allegheny\", cb = TRUE) %>% \n  select(GEOID)\n\nst_erase <- function(x, y) {\n  st_difference(x, st_union(y))\n}\n\nac_water <- area_water(\"PA\", \"Allegheny\", class = \"sf\")\n\nallegheny_county_tracts <- st_erase(allegheny_county_tracts, ac_water)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen I download the [\"Origin-Destination\" LODES](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) file from the Census for Pennsylvania in 2017 and subset it to commuters within Allegheny County.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_a47b024db6727ab01f1cb8220ad2d07d'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#load od tract-level data\nlodes_od_ac_main <- grab_lodes(state = \"pa\", year = 2017, \n                               lodes_type = \"od\", job_type = \"JT00\", \n                               segment = \"S000\", state_part = \"main\", \n                               agg_geo = \"tract\", use_cache = TRUE) %>%\n  select(state, w_tract, h_tract, S000, year) %>% \n  rename(commuters = S000) %>% \n  mutate(intra_tract_commute = h_tract == w_tract) %>% \n  semi_join(allegheny_county_tracts, by = c(\"w_tract\" = \"GEOID\")) %>% \n  semi_join(allegheny_county_tracts, by = c(\"h_tract\" = \"GEOID\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis analysis only considers routes where the commuter changed census tracts. 96% of commuters in Allegheny County change census tracts.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlodes_od_ac_main %>% \n  group_by(intra_tract_commute) %>% \n  summarize(commuters = sum(commuters)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(pct = commuters / sum(commuters))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  intra_tract_commute commuters    pct\n  <lgl>                   <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 FALSE                  465637 0.963 \n2 TRUE                    18127 0.0375\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Get directions\n\nThis is the code that identifies the center of each tract, geocodes those centroids to get an address, and gets the turn-by-turn directions and route data for each pair of home and work addresses.
