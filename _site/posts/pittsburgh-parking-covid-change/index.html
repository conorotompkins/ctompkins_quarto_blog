<p>The COVID-19 pandemic’s affect on commerce and mobility habits is well documented. For example, Apple publishes <a href="https://covid19.apple.com/mobility">Mobility Trends reports</a> about utilization of various transportation modes.</p>
<p><img src="apple_covid_mobility_trend.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Apple’s data shows that utilization of driving in Pittsburgh dropped significantly in late March, but has rebounded above pre-COVID-19 levels since then.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parking-transactions/resource/1ad5394f-d158-46c1-9af7-90a9ef4e0ce1">WPDRC</a> publishes parking meter transactions for 60 parking zones in Pittsburgh. In this post I will use the frequency of parking transactions over time as a proxy for commercial activity in the city. This information only represents commerce that people use vehicles to perform, so it does not include mass transit or drivers that use private parking areas or meters that are not captured in this dataset. I will be interested to see if the parking meter data matches Apple’s report about driving.</p>
