    "text": "This March, researchers at the University of Georgia and Florida State University released the HHUUD10 dataset, which contains estimates of the number of housing units for decennial census years 1940-2010 and 2019. A “housing unit” could be a studio apartment or 5 bedroom single-family home. The data uses 2010 census tracts, which allows for historical comparison of housing trends across constant geometry. The full paper explains the approach.\nThis paper and the dataset can be used for a wide variety of socioeconomic issues. I will focus on suburbanization trends in the Pittsburgh area."

Conversely, the tracts in the South Hills cover less land area, and less of the South Hills is useful for development because of steep hills and creeks. This concentrates development in a smaller area."

    "text": "Conclusion\nOver the past 80 years, Allegheny County has lost a significant amount of housing in its core urban area. Much of this is directly related to the collapse of the steel industry and “urban renewal”. At the same time, new housing development has been pushed out to the suburbs. This is a loss in terms of housing density, which has become a major discussion point in urban planning over the past 20 years.\nHigher density areas have a lower per capita carbon footprint due to non-car commute modes and agglomeration effects. Higher density also does not expand the wildland-urban interface. This leaves more land for the natural environment, moves humans away from dangers such as wildfires, and lowers the frequency of interaction between wild animals and humans, which can transfer disease (coronavirus, ebola). It will be interesting to see whether the suburbanization trend continues after the initial shocks of COVID-19 pandemic subside."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis blog post is about making Venn diagrams work in Shiny, and the issues I ran into with shiny::nearPoints(). I show how this impacted my initial approach, and discuss the underlying issue.\nTLDR; shiny::nearPoints() doesn’t work with dataframes containing list-columns the way I expected\n\n\nBackground\nI have been working on a Shiny app that I will use to plan birdwatching trips. It uses the {ebirdst} package to pull abundance data for hundreds of species of birds in 27x27km tiles in North America. A major feature of the app will be the ability to compare how similar two areas (tiles) are. This compares the abundance for a species in a given tile in a given month. I wanted to include a Venn diagram that shows which species are exclusive to each tile. The user can click on the Venn diagram to see the species associated with each segment of the Venn diagram.\nThis involves making a venn diagram in ggplot2 and extracting the segment that the user clicks on with nearPoints(). This was more challenging than I had anticipated.\n\n\nVenn diagram data\nnearPoints() requires:\n\ndf: a data frame with x and y coordinates it can interpret\ncoordinfo: the user click coordinates as captured from the ui\n\nI use the ggVennDiagram package to make the venn diagram plot. This package uses ggplot2, but does a lot of pre-processing of the data beforehand. This made it difficult to get access to the df for nearPoints().\nThis is an example of a ggVennDiagram plot. It takes a list object, turns that into a dataframe, and then uses sf to draw the circles.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggVennDiagram)\n\ngenes &lt;- paste(\"gene\",1:100,sep=\"\")\nset.seed(20210419)\nx &lt;- list(A=sample(genes,30),\n          B=sample(genes,50))\n\nggVennDiagram(x)\n\n\n\n\nLooking under the hood of ggVennDiagram() shows the pre-processing steps:\n\nvenn &lt;- Venn(x)\ndata &lt;- process_data(venn)\n\nVenn() creates an object with slots representing the two sets A and B\n\nVenn(x)\n\nAn object of class \"Venn\"\nSlot \"sets\":\n$A\n [1] \"gene27\" \"gene76\" \"gene57\" \"gene33\" \"gene78\" \"gene39\" \"gene63\" \"gene41\"\n [9] \"gene66\" \"gene17\" \"gene16\" \"gene69\" \"gene75\" \"gene9\"  \"gene68\" \"gene3\" \n[17] \"gene34\" \"gene54\" \"gene19\" \"gene83\" \"gene2\"  \"gene40\" \"gene87\" \"gene60\"\n[25] \"gene61\" \"gene24\" \"gene44\" \"gene93\" \"gene53\" \"gene7\" \n\n$B\n [1] \"gene84\"  \"gene36\"  \"gene37\"  \"gene47\"  \"gene91\"  \"gene46\"  \"gene92\" \n [8] \"gene33\"  \"gene67\"  \"gene73\"  \"gene25\"  \"gene5\"   \"gene63\"  \"gene2\"  \n[15] \"gene83\"  \"gene56\"  \"gene77\"  \"gene10\"  \"gene12\"  \"gene95\"  \"gene76\" \n[22] \"gene53\"  \"gene99\"  \"gene19\"  \"gene31\"  \"gene86\"  \"gene80\"  \"gene65\" \n[29] \"gene48\"  \"gene100\" \"gene89\"  \"gene58\"  \"gene35\"  \"gene30\"  \"gene21\" \n[36] \"gene44\"  \"gene72\"  \"gene18\"  \"gene45\"  \"gene42\"  \"gene1\"   \"gene27\" \n[43] \"gene90\"  \"gene14\"  \"gene43\"  \"gene26\"  \"gene96\"  \"gene17\"  \"gene16\" \n[50] \"gene29\" \n\n\nSlot \"names\":\n[1] \"A\" \"B\"\n\n\nprocess_data() turns those slots into dataframes with sf columns representing the segment polygons.\n\nvenn &lt;- Venn(x)\nprocess_data(venn)\n\nAn object of class \"VennPlotData\"\nSlot \"setEdge\":\nSimple feature collection with 2 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: LINESTRING\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 125 ymin: 250 xmax: 875 ymax: 750\nCRS:           NA\n# A tibble: 2 × 6\n  id                                        geometry component item  count name \n  &lt;chr&gt;                                 &lt;LINESTRING&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;nam&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 1     (500 716, 493.065 720.007, 485.954 723.777,… setEdge   &lt;chr&gt;    30 A    \n2 2     (500 284, 506.935 279.998, 514.046 276.243,… setEdge   &lt;chr&gt;    50 B    \n\nSlot \"setLabel\":\nSimple feature collection with 2 features and 3 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 250 ymin: 780 xmax: 750 ymax: 780\nCRS:           NA\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  id     geometry component name \n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;POINT&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;\n1 1     (250 780) setLabel  A    \n2 2     (750 780) setLabel  B    \n\nSlot \"region\":\nSimple feature collection with 3 features and 5 fields\nGeometry type: POLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 125 ymin: 250 xmax: 875 ymax: 750\nCRS:           NA\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  id                                        geometry component item  count name \n  &lt;chr&gt;                                    &lt;POLYGON&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;lis&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1 1     ((500 716, 492.317 711.329, 484.878 706.459… region    &lt;chr&gt;    19 A    \n2 2     ((500 284, 507.683 288.649, 515.122 293.497… region    &lt;chr&gt;    39 B    \n3 12    ((507.683 711.328, 515.122 706.458, 522.317… region    &lt;chr&gt;    11 A..B \n\n\nThe region slot is most important for my purposes.
