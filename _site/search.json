    "text": "This March, researchers at the University of Georgia and Florida State University released the HHUUD10 dataset, which contains estimates of the number of housing units for decennial census years 1940-2010 and 2019. A “housing unit” could be a studio apartment or 5 bedroom single-family home. The data uses 2010 census tracts, which allows for historical comparison of housing trends across constant geometry. The full paper explains the approach.\nThis paper and the dataset can be used for a wide variety of socioeconomic issues. I will focus on suburbanization trends in the Pittsburgh area."

My guess is that the tracts in the North Hills cover more land area, which decreases the % that is developed. Conversely, the tracts in the South Hills cover less land area, and less of the South Hills is useful for development because of steep hills and creeks. This concentrates development in a smaller area."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nOver the past 80 years, Allegheny County has lost a significant amount of housing in its core urban area. Much of this is directly related to the collapse of the steel industry and “urban renewal”. At the same time, new housing development has been pushed out to the suburbs. This is a loss in terms of housing density, which has become a major discussion point in urban planning over the past 20 years.\nHigher density areas have a lower per capita carbon footprint due to non-car commute modes and agglomeration effects. Higher density also does not expand the wildland-urban interface. This leaves more land for the natural environment, moves humans away from dangers such as wildfires, and lowers the frequency of interaction between wild animals and humans, which can transfer disease (coronavirus, ebola). It will be interesting to see whether the suburbanization trend continues after the initial shocks of COVID-19 pandemic subside."
